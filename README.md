# pands-problem-sheet
# This is the repository that I have created to store all my weekly tasks for Andrew Beattys
# programming and scripting course
# Week 1 Task:  
# We set up our programming environment and set up a github account committing a hellow world file to 
# to show that we had set up our environment correctly
# Week 2 Task:
# Our task was to set up a program to calculate a persons Body Mass Index BMI
# based on their inputted heights in meters and weight in kilograms.
# Week 3 Task:
# Our task was to develop a program which asked the user to input a sentence and the program outputted
# the sentence reversed with just every second letter
# Week 4 Task: 
# We developed a program asking  the user to input any positive integer
# which outputted the successive values of the following calculation.
# at each step the program calculates the next value by taking the current value and,
# if it is even, divides it by two,
# but if it is odd, it multiplies the value by three and adds one.
# The program ends if the value is one.
# Week 5 Task:
# Our task was to code a program to detect whether the current day was a weekday or not and output that information to the
# user
# Week 6 Task:
# Our taask was to develop a program to calculate the square root of a user inputted number.  It was recommended
# that we use the newton method to achieve this, as opposed to using inbuilt functions or modules.
# Week 7 Task:
# Our task was to develop a program that could read a file and return the count of a given number.  The name of the file
# to be read was to be specifed on the command line 
# Week 8 Task:
# the task to display a plot of the functions
# f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes
